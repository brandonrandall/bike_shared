# Bike Share

In this project we use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

We also:
* Use TDD throughout. Tests are created for all features and all models.
* Use HTML and CSS to style the pages.
* Use ActiveRecord migrations to create a normalized database
* Use intermediate ActiveRecord queries to calculate and report on information in the database
* Utilize ActiveRecord methods and relationships to efficiently query the database
* Use Sinatra and ERB templates to render views to create, read, update, and delete resources using RESTful routes and appropriate HTTP verbs
* Use Sinatra and ERB templates to display a dashboard not related to a specific resource saved in the database
* Use HTML and CSS to create a user experience that allows users to comfortably navigate a site
* Use RSpec to drive development at the feature and model levels.
* Use Git and GitHub to work collaboratively, develop in smaller groups, and resolve merge conflicts.
